Resources
- CSS, Javascript, HTML, Images : Static resources
- Dynamic resources (Server side technologies) : 
	- They send a dynamic or different html response to the client based on the request
	- That interact with a database and CRUD (Create, Read, update, delete), login
	- Logic that needs to execute at the server side

Server
 - Deployed on the server (web server)
 - Clients can send request to the server for the resources : URL (Address)

Django -> Complete web application (static + dynamic)
Static -> HTML project and deploy on the server

python --version
pip --version
pip install django
python -m django --version

- django-admin startproject firstwebapp

URL
home/ -> firstwebapp -> urls.py -> urlpatterns -> there is a match -> call a function which will generate the html to be sent in the response
